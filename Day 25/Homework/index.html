    <main>
        <h1 class="fire">Lust</h1>

        <p class="fire">
            Lust is a psychological force producing intense desire for something, or circumstance while already having a significant amount of the desired object.[citation needed] Lust can take any form such as the lust for sexuality (see libido), money, or power. It can take such mundane forms as the lust for food (see gluttony) as distinct from the need for food or lust for redolence, when one is lusting for a particular smell that brings back memories. It is similar to but distinguished from passion, in that passion propels individuals to achieve benevolent goals whilst lust does not.

        <h1 class="fire">Gluttony</h1>

        <p class="fire">In Christianity, it is considered a sin if the excessive desire for food leads to a lack of control over one's relation with food or harms the body.[1] Some Christian denominations consider gluttony one of the seven deadly sins.In Deut 21:20 and Proverbs 23:21, it is זלל.[2] The Gesenius Entry[3] (lower left word) has indications of "squandering" and "profligacy" (waste).

            In Matthew 11:19 and Luke 7:34, it is φαγος ("phagos" transliterated character for character),[4] The LSJ Entry[5] is tiny, and only refers to one external source, Zenobius Paroemiographus 1.73. The word could mean merely "an eater", since φαγω means "eat".
        </p>
        
        <h1 class="fire">Greed</h1>

        <p class="fire">
            Greed (or avarice) is an insatiable desire for material gain (be it food, money, land, or animate/inanimate possessions) or social value, such as status, or power. Greed has been identified as undesirable throughout known human history because it creates behavior-conflict between personal and social goals.
        </p>

        <h1 class="fire">Sloth</h1>

        <p class="fire">
            "Sloth" specifically addresses laziness, indifference, and a lack of motivation to fulfill one's obligations, whether they be moral, social, or personal. The concept of the seven deadly sins is not exclusive to Christianity and has been referenced in various forms in different cultures and religious traditions throughout history. The idea is to recognize these vices as obstacles to spiritual growth and moral development, encouraging individuals to strive for virtuous behavior instead.
        </p>

        <h1 class="fire">Wrath</h1>

        <p class="fire">
            "Wrath" is one of the seven deadly sins, often referred to as a cardinal sin or a capital vice in Christian theology. Wrath is typically understood as intense and vengeful anger, often accompanied by a desire for revenge or punishment. It is considered a serious moral failing because it can lead to harmful actions, violence, and the destruction of relationships.
            
            In the context of the seven deadly sins, wrath is seen as a destructive force that can harm both the person experiencing it and those who are its targets. The other six deadly sins are lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, and pride. The idea behind identifying these sins is to highlight behaviors and attitudes that can be harmful to individuals and society, hindering spiritual and moral growth.
        </p>

        <h1 class="fire">Envy</h1>

        <p class="fire">
            Envy is one of the seven deadly sins, and it refers to the feeling of discontent or resentment caused by someone else's possessions, qualities, or success. When someone experiences envy, they harbor a desire to possess what someone else has or to achieve the same level of success or recognition. Envy often involves a sense of rivalry or comparison and can lead to negative emotions such as bitterness, jealousy, and even hostility.
            In the context of the seven deadly sins, envy is considered harmful because it can lead to destructive behaviors and attitudes. It can erode relationships, foster a toxic environment, and hinder personal and spiritual growth.
        </p>

        <h1 class="fire">Pride</h1>

        <p class="fire">
            
        Pride" is one of the seven deadly sins, often categorized as a cardinal sin or a capital vice in Christian theology. Pride, in this context, refers to an excessive and inflated sense of one's own abilities, achievements, or status, leading to an attitude of superiority over others. It involves an exaggerated self-esteem and a disregard for the opinions or contributions of others.
        Pride is considered a serious moral failing because it can lead to arrogance, self-centeredness, and a lack of humility. In the context of the seven deadly sins, pride is seen as the root of all sin, as it is often associated with a refusal to acknowledge one's dependence on others and on a higher power.
